# FoodCourt QA Engineer Assessment

### Test Automation of the login process done on `login.cy.js` of `App.js` using cypress automation tool

```
Check Page Elements:
Verifies that the login page on App.js is displayed by checking the presence of the heading.

Invalid Login:
Enters incorrect credentials.
Clicks the login button.
Asserts that the error message is visible and contains the correct text.

Asserts that the error message is visible and contains the correct text.

Handle Only Password Input:
Enters only the password.
Clicks the login button.

### Performance Testing

#### Create a test case for Order Placement with Configuring Multiple Users.

```
Design:

One of the Key Scenarios: Multiple users add some product in cart with multiple request then placing order simultaneously.

Set Up Test Environment: Have a staging environment that looks exactly like your production.

Write Test Scripts: Execute users ordering and add orders to the cart using a load testing tools.


Tools:

Apache JMeter: Open source software, designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

Gatling: Support for complex load testing scenarios, tidy performance testing due to its scripting language.

Locust: the easy and scalable way to test your code


Why:

JMeter: Classic and intuitive, with a broad user community and libraries.

Gatling: Scala Library for the most expressive and expedition test scenarios, ever.

Locust â€” simple load-testing framework


Example of JMeter Test Plan

Thread Group: Simulate more user

HyperText Transfer Protocol request: Order placement in this case is the http order.

Assertions -- whether the responses were successful or errors.
```

### API Testing

#### Test an API Endpoint to Retrieve the List of Available Restaurants

```
Positive Test Cases:

Valid Request:
Send a GET request to /api/restaurants.
Assert the status code is 200.
Assert the response contains a list of restaurants with valid details (e.g., name, location, cuisine).


Negative Test Cases:

Invalid Endpoint:
Send a GET request to /api/nonexistent.
Assert the status code is 404.
Assert the response contains an appropriate error message.

Unauthorized Access:
Send a GET request to /api/restaurants without authentication if the endpoint requires it.
Assert the status code is 401.
Assert the response contains an appropriate error message.


Example using Postman/Newman
Create Collection: Add requests for positive and negative scenarios.
Run Collection: Use Newman to run the collection and generate reports.
```

```javascript
// Postman request example
{
  "info": {
    "name": "Restaurant API Test",
    "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "Get Restaurants",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "header": [],
        "url": {
          "raw": "http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants",
          "protocol": "http",
          "host": [
            "localhost"
          ],
          "port": "3000",
          "path": [
            "api",
            "restaurants"
          ]
        }
      },
      "response": []
    }
  ]
}



```

### Database Testing

#### Verify Data Integrity and Consistency

```javascript

```

### End-to-End Testing

#### User Journey: Search for a Restaurant, Place an Order, Make a Payment, Receive Order Confirmation

```javascript

```
